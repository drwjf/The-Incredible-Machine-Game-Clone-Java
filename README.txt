Welcome to the Incredible Machine Game Clone

This was a group project done in one of my final years of university


This release is accompanied by a Single executable JAR FILE called: TimRunner
to run it simply double click it to execute

Note: JDK or JRE 1.6+ is required to run this game.

This release also includes the eclipse project files for easy import

I make no garuntee's this will work as future versions of Eclipse/JDK are released.
